# Classification-of-Song-Lyrics-Written-by-Native-vs.-Non-Native-English-Speakers

## Overview
This project presents a study on classifying English-language song lyrics based on whether they were written by native or non-native English speakers. The research explores linguistic and cultural factors influencing songwriting, utilizing a dataset of 4,941 songs and multiple machine learning approaches.

## Methodology
**Dataset**: Curated collection of song lyrics, balanced between native and non-native artists. Publicly available here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/AdelaCorbeanu/English-Lyrical-Origins 

**Models Used**: Naive Bayes, Suport Vector Machine, Random Forest, Transformer-based models, and unsupervised methods like K-Medoids and Self-Organizing Maps.

#### Ethical Considerations
The study should not be used to stereotype or undervalue non-native English artists.
Machine learning results should be interpreted with cultural and artistic context in mind.
